# Skynet Substrate

## Developing

### Testing

Tests can be run by executing

```
cargo test
```

Code coverage can be profiled by installing and running `cargo-tarpaulin` (Linux-only):

```
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin
```

If you're not developing on a Linux system, you can just raise a PR on our repo
and our CI will profile the coverage.
